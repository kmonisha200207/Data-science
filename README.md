# E-commerce Data Analysis and Modeling

This project is focused on analyzing an e-commerce platform's customer transactions. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike model to recommend similar customers, and performing customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The goal is to gain insights from the data, improve business strategies, and enhance customer targeting.

## Project Overview

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of the e-commerce dataset and derive actionable business insights.
- **Deliverables**:
  - **`EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for EDA (data cleaning, visualizations, and analysis).
  - **`EDA.pdf`**: PDF report summarizing 5 business insights drawn from the analysis.
- **Steps**: 
  - Load the provided data files.
  - Clean and preprocess the data.
  - Visualize key trends and patterns.
  - Derive insights about customer behavior, transactions, and product popularity.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective**: Build a Lookalike model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Deliverables**:
  - **`Lookalike.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook implementing the Lookalike model.
  - **`Lookalike.csv`**: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalike customers for the first 20 customers with their similarity scores.
- **Steps**:
  - Preprocess and aggregate the customer and transaction data.
  - Use a similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) to recommend top similar customers.
  - Output recommendations for the first 20 customers into `Lookalike.csv`.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Objective**: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques, segmenting customers based on transaction data and profile features.
- **Deliverables**:
  - **`Clustering.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing clustering code (K-Means or another clustering algorithm).
  - **`Clustering.pdf`**: PDF report summarizing the segmentation results, including evaluation metrics like the DB Index.
- **Steps**:
  - Aggregate customer and transaction data.
  - Apply clustering techniques to segment customers.
  - Evaluate the clustering results with metrics such as the DB Index.
  - Visualize the clusters and summarize findings.
